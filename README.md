# AsssignmentOne
This is my first webpage so I hope you like it! <br>
I have never used HTML or CSS before and I know it could use some refinement. <br>
The CSS is a separate file type which is contained within the same folder. <br>
I have also never used GitHub before so I hope this works! (puts hands together XD).
#I've used brackets.io as my text editor which you can download a desktop version for PC straight from the website.
